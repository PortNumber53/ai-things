 What's up everybody? This is Cortland from AndyHackers.com and you're listening
to the

00:11.440 --> 00:15.720
 Andy Hackers podcast. More people than ever are building cool stuff online and
making

00:15.720 --> 00:19.000
 a lot of money in the process. And on this show, I sit down with these Andy
Hackers to

00:19.000 --> 00:23.440
 discuss the ideas, the opportunities and the strategies they're taking
advantage of so

00:23.440 --> 00:29.440
 the rest of us can do the same.

00:29.440 --> 00:34.080
 I'm here with Justin Jackson, the founder of Transistor, which is a very
successful podcast

00:34.080 --> 00:38.880
 hosting company. It's what I'm using to host this podcast and also my other
podcast brains.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.800
 Justin, welcome back to Andy Hackers. I think this is your third time on the
show.

00:42.800 --> 00:48.080
 Yeah. Well, it's good. It's just good to chat with you. It's actually good to
chat with

00:48.080 --> 00:50.080
 any human being these days.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.320
 Yeah. Well, you're particularly fun to talk to you because it's very easy to
talk to.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.440
 We have our Twitter DMs back and forth where we share random thoughts on stuff,
but it's

00:58.440 --> 00:59.920
 good to just flow.

00:59.920 --> 01:05.440
 Yeah, totally. I've noticed the change in the way you do the show. When I
listen, it's

01:05.440 --> 01:07.440
 become a lot more conversational.

01:07.440 --> 01:12.520
 Yeah. Well, it's much more fun to have authentic, normal conversations. And
there's this idea

01:12.520 --> 01:18.600
 of a... You're familiar with the concept of an overton window. It's kind of
like, what

01:18.640 --> 01:23.120
 are you allowed to say? What are you not allowed to say? There's kind of like,
impolite society.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.760
 There's just balance on things that everybody agrees are okay and everybody
doesn't agree

01:26.760 --> 01:27.760
 are okay.

01:27.760 --> 01:32.360
 And I think if you have a show or an audience, Twitter account, newsletter or
whatever, you

01:32.360 --> 01:37.080
 kind of create your own overton window, meaning that whatever it is that you
put out, the

01:37.080 --> 01:40.960
 people who like it will stick with you and the people who don't won't. And so
you can

01:40.960 --> 01:46.560
 kind of do whatever you want on your own show. But once you pick something,
you're kind of

01:46.600 --> 01:50.720
 locked into it because now your audience wants that. And so it's always kind of
hard to change

01:50.720 --> 01:53.480
 the format of a podcast show because it's like, if I've been doing interviews
for a long

01:53.480 --> 01:57.000
 time and then I'm like, you know what? I want to do more conversational stuff.
A lot of

01:57.000 --> 02:00.440
 people will be like, what the hell? What happened to the interviews?

02:00.440 --> 02:06.520
 Yeah. What an interesting idea. Like what's Bon Jovi's overton window? It's
like, everyone

02:06.520 --> 02:13.520
 wants to hear the same songs over and over again. They don't want anything new,
right?

02:13.680 --> 02:14.480
 You get locked in.

02:15.080 --> 02:24.480
 Yeah. Yeah. And this is a real actual, this is a fundamental challenge of life,
which is I do

02:24.480 --> 02:31.600
 think people need to grow, businesses need to grow and change and adapt. And
people don't

02:31.600 --> 02:38.320
 like change. But if you don't change, you kind of, you can recede, you know,
you can, your

02:38.320 --> 02:43.960
 business can die over time just because it becomes gradually more irrelevant or
doesn't

02:43.960 --> 02:49.920
 respond to current market conditions. And then you as a person, you know, you
might
