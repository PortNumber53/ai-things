00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,440
What's up everybody? This is Cortland from AndyHackers.com and you're listening
to the

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,720
Andy Hackers podcast. More people than ever are building cool stuff online and
making

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,000
a lot of money in the process. And on this show, I sit down with these Andy
Hackers to

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,440
discuss the ideas, the opportunities and the strategies they're taking advantage
of so

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,440
the rest of us can do the same.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,080
I'm here with Justin Jackson, the founder of Transistor, which is a very
successful podcast

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,880
hosting company. It's what I'm using to host this podcast and also my other
podcast brains.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,800
Justin, welcome back to Andy Hackers. I think this is your third time on the
show.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,080
Yeah. Well, it's good. It's just good to chat with you. It's actually good to
chat with

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,080
any human being these days.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,320
Yeah. Well, you're particularly fun to talk to you because it's very easy to
talk to.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,440
We have our Twitter DMs back and forth where we share random thoughts on stuff,
but it's

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,920
good to just flow.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,440
Yeah, totally. I've noticed the change in the way you do the show. When I
listen, it's

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,440
become a lot more conversational.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,520
Yeah. Well, it's much more fun to have authentic, normal conversations. And
there's this idea

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,600
of a... You're familiar with the concept of an overton window. It's kind of
like, what

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,120
are you allowed to say? What are you not allowed to say? There's kind of like,
impolite society.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,760
There's just balance on things that everybody agrees are okay and everybody
doesn't agree

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
are okay.

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,360
And I think if you have a show or an audience, Twitter account, newsletter or
whatever, you

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,080
kind of create your own overton window, meaning that whatever it is that you put
out, the

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,960
people who like it will stick with you and the people who don't won't. And so
you can

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,560
kind of do whatever you want on your own show. But once you pick something,
you're kind of

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,720
locked into it because now your audience wants that. And so it's always kind of
hard to change

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,480
the format of a podcast show because it's like, if I've been doing interviews
for a long

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,000
time and then I'm like, you know what? I want to do more conversational stuff. A
lot of

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,440
people will be like, what the hell? What happened to the interviews?

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,520
Yeah. What an interesting idea. Like what's Bon Jovi's overton window? It's
like, everyone

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,520
wants to hear the same songs over and over again. They don't want anything new,
right?

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,480
You get locked in.

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:24,480
Yeah. Yeah. And this is a real actual, this is a fundamental challenge of life,
which is I do

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,600
think people need to grow, businesses need to grow and change and adapt. And
people don't

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,320
like change. But if you don't change, you kind of, you can recede, you know, you
can, your

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,960
business can die over time just because it becomes gradually more irrelevant or
doesn't

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,920
respond to current market conditions. And then you as a person, you know, you
might
